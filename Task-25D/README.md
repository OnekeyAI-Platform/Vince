## 2.5D Rectal Cancer

**Abstract**

Purpose: Pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was utilized to develop and validate a deep learning-based prognostic model for rectal cancer.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively collected data from 458 patients across three hospitals and followed them for a minimum of three years. Clinical, pathological, and imaging data were collected for analysis. Multi-instance learning (MIL) was applied to integrate predictions across multiple slices, enhancing the model's performance. To further improve prediction accuracy, a nomogram was developed that combines deep MRI-based features with clinicopathologic parameters. The model's effectiveness was evaluated using Harrellâ€™s C-index and time-dependent ROC curves.. 

Results: The training set consisted of 268 patients, the validation set included 115 patients, and the external test set had 75 patients. The MIL model outperformed the clinical model in predicting both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in several cohorts. For OS, the MIL model achieved c-index values of 0.757 in the training cohort, 0.754 in the validation cohort, and 0.741 in the test cohort, compared to the clinical model's values of 0.666, 0.772, and 0.756, respectively. The combined model, integrating MIL features with clinical features, further enhanced predictive accuracy, showing the highest C-index values for OS (0.819, 0.822, 0.759) and DFS (0.769, 0.747, 0.721) across all cohorts. 

Conclusion: The MRI-based deep learning model demonstrated potential in predicting the prognosis of rectal cancer patients and can serve as a pretreatment risk stratification tool, helping clinicians develop more personalized treatment strategies.
